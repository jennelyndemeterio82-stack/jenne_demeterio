            <h1> COMPARATIVE PERPORMANCE OF MUNGBEAN (TAIWAN GREEEN VAR.) AS AFFECTED BY VARYING ROW SPACING GROWN 
                 UNDER WESTERN SAMAR CONDITION</h1>
            <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <h4>Nature and Importance of the study</h4>
            <p>Mungbean (Vigna Radiata) is a leguminous annual crop with a height from 30 to 100 centimeters depending upon the variety. 
                It is considered as one of the most important pulse crops with various uses. Due to this fact many farmers are encouraged to plant
                 mungbeans (Mitchelle R.L,.1979). 
                 In the Visayas, mungbean has been grown by many farmers to utilize the area previously planted with other crops to earn extra income.
                 being a leguminous crop, mungbean has the ability to utilize atmospheric nitrogen in the symbiotic association with 
                 rhizobium - a nitrogen fixing bacteria, to produce nutrient that would be beneficial to the soil and consequently to the plant planted
                 in the next season.</p>

            <p>Moreover, mungbean is a fast growing and early maturing crop (PCARR, 1978). It produces more herbage making it an excellent material 
                 for green manuring. when properly decomposed, it adds organic matter, such as potassium and phosphorus from plant residues to te soil, 
                 thus, improving the soils physical and chemical properties.</p>

            <p>For human consumption, mungbean is utilized in the form of young pods, dried seeds or sprouted,making it as one of the identified 
                 cultivated grain legumes grown in the Philippines. </p>

            <p>Over the years, the probative cost of meat contributes to mungbeans popularity as cheap and excellent source of proteins and minerals 
                 for human consumption, hence it has been tagged as "poor man's meat". This is manifested in the protein content together with vitamins 
                 and minerals, like calcium and sodium, in seeds that ranges from 20 - 70% (PCAAR, 1979). In terms of thiamine, riboflavin and iron, 
                 mungbean has higher content than either rice or corn making it as one of the cheapest source of vitamins and minerals.</p>

            <p>Among the other desirable economic attribute of the dried seeds of mungbean are its basic ingredient of food specialties such as hopia, 
                 butse-butse, halo-halo, sotanghon, or just selling them in the public markets.</p>

            <p>However, amid of these considerable and important moves were made for the mungbean production in our locality. This situation leads to 
                 our insufficiency of local supply which could not equate the needs of our people. Thus, our local market had to buy the foodstuff 
                 from other nearby towns.</p>

            <p>To solve this problem and to enhance the market potential of mungbean, considerable attention should be made to meet local demand and 
                 improve crop production and management especially that high local demand is noticeable as evidenced by the favorable price of the 
                 commodity in comparison with other grain legumes.</p>

            <p>The aforementioned realities had, therefore, prompted the researchers to undertake this particular study using selected production 
                variebles as the foucs of the investigation.</p>

            <h4>Objectives:</h4>
            <p>The study aims to:</p>
            <P>1. Evaluate the growth and yield performance of mungbean as affected by varying row spacing;</P>
            <p>2. Determine the most appropriate row spacing for mungbean that would give the highest yield; and</p>
            <p>3. Compare the production cost and return of mungbean production in affected by varying row spacing.</p>
           
            <h4>Time and Place of the Study</h4>
            <p>This study was conducted in Brgy. Lambao, Sta. Margarita, Western Samar from October 4, to December 13, 2003</p>
          
            <h4>Scope and Limitations of the Study</h4>
            <p>This study was conducted to determine the comparative performance of Taiwan green mungbean variety as affected by varying row spacings 
                 grown under Sta. Margarita, Western Samar condition.</p>
            <p>The data gathered in this experimental research were limited on mungbean's agronomic characteristics, yield and yield conponents, 
                 harvest index, cost and return analysis, and climatic data.</p>
