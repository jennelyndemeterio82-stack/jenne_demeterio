                Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
                That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
                I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
                And she's got everything that I have to live without
               
                Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
                But I can't even see anyone when he's with me
                He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
                I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
               
                He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
                The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
                He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
              
                Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
                And there he goes, so perfectly
                The kind of flawless I wish I could be
                She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
                Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
                
                He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
                The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
                He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
               
                So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
                I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
               
                'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
                The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
                He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
                He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
                And he's all that I need to fall into
              
                Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
